          <p>
            A rapidly growing e-commerce platform selling specialty products nationwide was facing increasing security
            challenges as their business expanded. With over 50,000 monthly active users and processing thousands of
            transactions daily, they had become an attractive target for cybercriminals.
          </p>
          <p>The client was experiencing several critical issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Frequent attempts at credential stuffing attacks targeting customer accounts</li>
            <li>Periodic DDoS attacks disrupting service during promotional events</li>
            <li>Increasing cases of payment fraud affecting both customers and the business</li>
            <li>Limited visibility into security events across their cloud infrastructure</li>
            <li>Compliance concerns related to PCI DSS requirements</li>
            <li>Stretched internal IT team without dedicated security personnel</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These security challenges were not only causing direct financial losses but also beginning to impact
            customer trust and brand reputation. The company needed a comprehensive security monitoring solution that
            could scale with their business while providing robust protection for their platform and customers.

              <p>This project provided valuable insights that have informed our approach to e-commerce security:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>E-commerce security requires specialized knowledge.</strong> The unique challenges of
                  protecting online retail operations demand deep understanding of both security and e-commerce business
                  models.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Balancing security with user experience is critical.</strong> Security measures must be
                  effective while minimizing friction in the customer journey.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fraud patterns evolve rapidly.</strong> Continuous refinement of detection rules and machine
                  learning models is essential to stay ahead of emerging fraud tactics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Peak traffic events require special planning.</strong> Security monitoring must scale
                  seamlessly during promotional events and holiday seasons.
